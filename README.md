Large-scale Information Extraction from Neuroscientific Literature

## Abstract

This report presents a new, clever strategy for automatic remote de- pendencies handling in Sherlok, an open source, large-scale, text mining, RESTful service based on UIMA technologies like bluima, which focuses on neuroscientific data extraction to help scientists at the Blue Brain Project collect information such as connections between brain regions from the vast available literature. The presented strategy is based on a thorough analysis of Sherlokâ€™s needs. Additionally, we suggest a general direction for further development of Sherlok and bluima.
